# **1. Preface: Welcome, Cohort Dungeon Master**

The RaidGuild Cohort is more than a workshop series or an onboarding funnel — it is a **monthly campaign** where adventurers gather to explore emerging technologies, sharpen their craft, and collaborate on real, shippable products. Each cohort brings together veteran Raiders, new apprentices, and curious wanderers who share a simple belief: **building together is the strongest spell we know.**

As a Cohort Dungeon Master (CDM), you are the steward of this journey. You set the tone, guide the narrative, and ensure that every participant has a path to contribute meaningfully. Your role isn’t to control the story, but to **shape the environment** so that the story can emerge. You provide the structure, the rituals, the rhythm — and the cohort brings the energy, creativity, and chaos that give it life.

## Not a Hackathon

It’s important to understand — and to communicate — that a cohort is not a hackathon.
Hackathons can attract drive-by bounty hunters and one-off participation; people show up for the prize and disappear the moment judging ends. Cohorts are different. They are designed to build relationships, not transactions; to create ongoing engagement, not weekend bursts; and to encourage skin in the game rather than extractive contribution. Cohorts cultivate community, mentorship, team formation, and long-term ownership of the work produced along the way. We are growing guildmates, not harvesting submissions.

This Guidebook exists to help you run a successful cohort with confidence and repeatability. Inside you will find a framework for the month’s arc, step-by-step encounter guides, practical checklists, troubleshooting wisdom, and cultural lore passed down by previous hosts. Use it as a map, not a mandate. Each cohort is a living world — adaptable, unpredictable, and responsive to the players who show up.

Your goal is simple:

* **Activate people.**
* **Help them ship something real.**
* **Grow the Guild’s collective strength.**

If you do that, the cohort succeeds.

Whether you are a returning host or stepping into the DM role for the first time, know that you are joining a long tradition of Raiders who believe in collaboration, open knowledge, and building public goods. Thank you for carrying that torch.

Now gather your materials, prepare the tavern, and ready the stage.

The campaign is about to begin.
