# **6. Loot, XP & Progression**

Progression in RaidGuild functions like an RPG advancement path — except instead of killing monsters, you ship things, collaborate, support the Guild, and show up consistently.

This section defines how players “level up” through the Guild, what loot they receive, and how they eventually become core members.

# **🌱 6.1 Stage 1 — Cohort Participant → Cohort Grad**

**How you earn this advancement:**

* Attend and participate in Week 1
* Join a project team
* Contribute meaningfully throughout the month
* Present a demo *or* participate consistently even if the demo doesn’t materialize

**Reward (Loot):**

* Access to weekly standups
* Ability to join RIPs and RAIDs
* Eligible to mentor in future cohorts

# **⚔️ 6.2 Stage 2 — Cohort Grad → Active Raider**

After graduation, the next step is to **participate in RAIDs and RIPs**, contributing real work to the Guild.

**Requirements:**

* Join at least one RIP (internal RG project or research initiative)

To be considered for core membership, a Raider must:

* Be a Cohort Graduate
* Participate in at least one RIP
* Participate in at least one RAID
* Demonstrate Guild values
* Have a **current Core Member stake on them** (nomination)

This sponsorship is meaningful — it’s a personal endorsement of trust, character, and consistency.

# **👑 6.4 Stage 4 — Core Member**

If the membership proposal passes:

* They become a **Core Member**

This mechanism ensures responsible sponsorship and sustained engagement.
