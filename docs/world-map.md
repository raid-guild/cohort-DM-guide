# **2. World Map: The Cohort Journey**

The Cohort Journey follows a monthly arc built around **an intensive, highly interactive first week**, followed by **three weeks of async collaboration**. This rhythm gives participants a strong social foundation early, then the freedom and agency to build at their own pace — the same way RaidGuild itself operates.

The world map below outlines the full path, including the day-by-day flow of Week 1.

---

# **🗺️ Region I: The Gate of Entry**

### *(Week 1 — Live Interactive Sessions, 1–2 hrs/day)*

This is the “arrival at the tavern” phase — immersive, social, high-touch — where participants meet each other, understand the culture, and begin thinking like Raiders.

---

## **Day 1 — Welcome, Introductions & Theme Reveal**

Participants get to know each other, learn how the Guild operates, and receive the month’s theme.

**Focus:**

* Who’s here? What are their skills?
* What is RaidGuild? (culture, structure, expectations)
* What is this month’s theme?
* What does success look like?

**DM Objective:**
Set a welcoming tone. Establish belonging. Make it clear that this is a **collaborative journey, not a hackathon**.

---

## **Day 2 — Raider Showcase (Monthly Standup)**

Cohort members sit inside RaidGuild’s monthly all-hands.

This is the moment when participants “see behind the curtain.”

**What they experience:**

* Status updates from active RAIDs
* RIPs reporting on progress
* OGs sharing new ventures, experiments, freelance work, governance updates
* A cross-section of the entire Guild’s heartbeat
* Areas where help is needed
* Momentum, culture, and expectations in practice

This is the point where many participants decide whether the Guild “clicks” for them. RG runs in a decentralized, self-directed, high-agency way — and this is where that becomes real.

**DM Objective:**
Let them witness the living organism of RaidGuild. No explanation is as powerful as the lived experience.

---

## **Day 3 — Demo Day (Previous Cohort) + Theme Ideation Kickoff**

Cohort members watch the final demos from last month’s builders.

**What this accomplishes:**

* Sets the bar for what “shipping” means
* Shows the diversity of valid projects (tools, MVPs, research, ops improvements)
* Establishes continuity between cohorts

Afterwards:

* Begin guided ideation around this month’s theme
* Introduce preliminary use cases
* Warm-up brainstorming exercises

**DM Objective:**
Inspire the new cohort with real projects. Show them what is possible. Then start nudging them into creative mode.

---

## **Day 4 — Deep Dive + Divergent Ideation Workshops**

A major exploration + creativity day.

**Activities may include:**

* Meme Driven Development
* Social icebreakers
* Hands-on theme deep dive
* Technical brown bag / lightning talk
* Creative breakouts
* Use-case brainstorming

The goal: **generate a wide range of divergent ideas**.
Homework: bring back one wildcard or unconventional idea.

**DM Objective:**
Spark creativity. Lower social friction. Push people to think bigger and stranger.

---

## **Day 5 — Convergence & Team Formation**

Today, divergent ideas converge into actual project paths.

**Goals:**

* Align on 1–3 viable project directions
* Form teams with balanced skill sets (product + front-end + back-end + ops/PM)
* Agree on initial roles
* Define early scopes

By the end of Day 5, the cohort has:

* Teams
* A project direction
* A sense of momentum

**DM Objective:**
Facilitate matchmaking and alignment. Gently guide toward commitment and clarity.

---

# **🏕️ Regions II–IV: The Async Buildlands**

After the intensity of Week 1, the cohort shifts into asynchronous execution — mirroring how real raids operate inside RaidGuild.

---

## **🏕️ Region II: Planning & Specification (Week 2 — Async)**

This week is about establishing the foundation.

**Common Activities:**

* Finalizing team roles
* Writing the product spec
* Setting up repos, tools, and PM boards
* Establishing communication patterns
* Early research & prototyping
* Optional office hours with hosts

**DM Objective:**
Keep teams unblocked and aligned. Encourage early clarity to prevent Week 3 chaos.

---

## **🛠️ Region III: Implementation & Iteration (Week 3 — Async)**

Teams work mostly independently, checking in as needed.

**Work includes:**

* Active development
* Iteration on prototypes
* Integrating feedback
* Polishing UI/UX
* Drafting early demo materials

**DM Objective:**
Encourage momentum. Connect teams with mentors. Keep teams honest about scope.

---

## **⚙️ Region IV: Polish, Testing & Demo Prep (Week 4 — Async)**

The final push before Demo Day (held during the next cohort’s Day 3).

**Activities:**

* Testing
* Bug fixing
* Preparing demo flows
* Writing decks
* Rehearsing presentations

**DM Objective:**
Help teams focus on delivering something usable, visible, and real — even if scrappy.

---

# **🏛️ Region V: The Arena (Demo Day — Next Cohort, Day 3)**

Demo Day happens during the next cohort’s Week 1, creating a **bridge between generations** of Raiders.

**Outcomes:**

* Present live demos
* Evaluate projects
* Award Raider of the Month
* Decide on membership sponsorships
* Celebrate wins

This ritual creates continuity, connection, and shared culture.
