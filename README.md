# RaidGuild Cohort DM Guide 📘

A Dungeon-Master-style playbook for running monthly cohorts in RaidGuild.

## Overview

The Cohort DM Guide is a **living manual** for running RaidGuild’s monthly cohorts.  
It codifies the process: onboarding → ideation → team formation → async build → Demo Day → graduation → integration into RAIDs & RIPs.

This guide ensures:
- clear expectations for participants  
- consistent facilitation across hosts  
- smooth onboarding for new DMs  
- stronger connection across core members, grads, and new Raiders

## Why This Guide Exists

RaidGuild cohorts have evolved organically through experience, vibes, and oral tradition.  
This guide transforms that tacit knowledge into:
- a repeatable framework  
- a clear pathway for new hosts  
- a sustainable system for growth  
- a shared cultural artifact
