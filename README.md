# RaidGuild Cohort DM Guide 📘

A Dungeon-Master-style playbook for running monthly cohorts in RaidGuild.  
This guide defines the structure, roles, rituals, quests, and progression system behind the Cohort program — making it easier for any host (DM) to run a strong, consistent, culture-aligned cohort.

Now served as a [Nextra docs site](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/start) with RaidGuild branding (fonts, palette, lore).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` for the live docs. Pages live under `app/guide/` (App Router, MDX).

## Branding

Brand tokens, fonts, and setup notes are captured in `RG_BRAND_AGENTS.md` and applied via `styles.css` and `app/layout.jsx`. Fonts live in `public/fonts/`.

## Overview

The Cohort DM Guide is a **living manual** for running RaidGuild’s monthly cohorts.  
It codifies the process: onboarding → ideation → team formation → async build → Demo Day → graduation → integration into RAIDs & RIPs.

This guide ensures:
- clear expectations for participants  
- consistent facilitation across hosts  
- smooth onboarding for new DMs  
- stronger connection across core members, grads, and new Raiders

## Why This Guide Exists

RaidGuild cohorts have evolved organically through experience, vibes, and oral tradition.  
This guide transforms that tacit knowledge into:
- a repeatable framework  
- a clear pathway for new hosts  
- a sustainable system for growth  
- a shared cultural artifact

## How to Use This Guide

**Mentors / Judges / OG Members**
