# 8. Campaign Variants & Alternative Cohort Formats

These formats reuse the same **quests, roles, encounters, and progression**, but compress or reshape the timeline.

---

## ⚡ Format A: The Hyper Sprint (1-Day Intensive)

**Use when:**

* Conference-adjacent events
* Retreats / offsites
* Partner DAOs
* Onboarding bursts
* “Taste of RaidGuild” experiences
* High-energy, limited-time windows

Think: **one-day dungeon crawl**, not a marathon.

---

### 🎯 Goal of the Hyper Sprint

* Rapid immersion into RaidGuild culture
* Hands-on collaboration
* One concrete artifact by end of day
* Strong signal on who “gets it”

This is *not* about polish — it’s about **activation**.

### **Act I — Arrival & Alignment (1–1.5 hrs)**

**Encounter: Welcome to the Tavern**

* Intros (fast, structured)
* What RaidGuild is (and isn’t)

* Show 1–2 prior demos (short)

**Output:** shared context + energy

---

### **Act II — Divergence (1.5 hrs)**

### **Act IV — Build Sprint (2–3 hrs)**

---

### **Act V — Demo & Reflection (1 hr)**

**Encounter: The Arena**

* 3–5 min demos per team
* Group reflection

## 🧠 Key Design Principles Across All Formats

These are invariant — regardless of length:

* **Not a hackathon**
* **Relationships > submissions**
* **Agency > assignments**
* **Shipping > perfection**
* **Culture is taught by participation**
* **Progression is earned, not granted**

The format changes.
The *values do not*.
