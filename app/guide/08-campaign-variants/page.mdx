These formats reuse the same **quests, roles, encounters, and progression**, but compress or reshape the timeline.

---

## <img src="/iconography/dd/sprint.svg" alt="Hyper sprint format icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />Format A: The Hyper Sprint (1-Day Intensive)

**Use when:**

* Conference-adjacent events
* Retreats / offsites
* Partner DAOs
* Onboarding bursts
* “Taste of RaidGuild” experiences
* High-energy, limited-time windows

Think: **one-day dungeon crawl**, not a marathon.

### <img src="/iconography/magic/star.svg" alt="Hyper sprint goal icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />Goal of the Hyper Sprint

* Rapid immersion into RaidGuild culture
* Hands-on collaboration
* One concrete artifact by end of day
* Strong signal on who “gets it”

This is *not* about polish — it’s about **activation**.

## <img src="/iconography/dd/culture.svg" alt="Campaign design principles icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />Key Design Principles Across All Formats

These are invariant — regardless of length:

* **Not a hackathon**
* **Relationships > submissions**
* **Agency > assignments**
* **Shipping > perfection**
* **Culture is taught by participation**
* **Progression is earned, not granted**

The format changes.
The *values do not*.
