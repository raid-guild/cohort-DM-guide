*Portable campaigns for ecosystems that want builders, not spectators.*

RaidGuild’s Cohort system is not just an internal onboarding mechanism — it is a **reusable, battle-tested format** that can be deployed as a service for other ecosystems, chains, DAOs, protocols, and communities.

Cohort as a Service (CaaS) packages the Guild’s facilitation, culture, and build mechanics into a **turn-key program** that helps partners activate builders, generate real projects, and cultivate long-term contributors.

## <img src="/iconography/dd/manifesto.svg" alt="What CaaS is icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />What CaaS Is (and Is Not)

**CaaS is:**

* A structured, facilitated build campaign
* Focused on real outputs and relationships
* Designed to surface high-signal contributors
* Adaptable in format (Hyper Sprint, Mini-Cohort, Full Cohort)
* Run by experienced RaidGuild hosts and mentors

**CaaS is not:**

* A hackathon
* A bounty farm
* A demo theater
* A one-off marketing stunt

The goal is not “submissions” — it’s **activation, education, and retention**.

## <img src="/iconography/dd/community.svg" alt="Who CaaS is for icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />Who CaaS Is For

CaaS is a good fit for partners who want to:

* Onboard builders into a new chain or protocol
* Activate a dormant or passive community
* Explore a new technical primitive (EIP, standard, SDK)
* Generate reference implementations
* Identify long-term contributors or grantees
* Seed an ecosystem with aligned builders
* Run conference-adjacent or residency-style programs

Examples:

* L2s and appchains
* DAO ecosystems
* Grant programs
* Protocol foundations
* DevRel teams
* Research collectives

## <img src="/iconography/magic/hourglass.svg" alt="CaaS formats icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />CaaS Formats

CaaS supports multiple delivery formats, depending on partner needs:

### <img src="/iconography/dd/sprint.svg" alt="CaaS Hyper Sprint icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />Hyper Sprint (1 Day)

* Conference or offsite activation
* Fast immersion + artifact generation
* Low friction, high energy
* Ideal for first touch or pilots

### <img src="/iconography/magic/hourglass.svg" alt="CaaS Mini-Cohort icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />Mini-Cohort (1 Week, In-Person or Hybrid)

* Deeper relationship building
* Mentor rotations
* Strong demo outcomes
* Great for city-based or residency programs

### <img src="/iconography/dd/dao.svg" alt="CaaS Full Cohort icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />Full Cohort (4–5 Weeks)

* Deep technical exploration
* Multiple teams and projects
* Async build cycles
* Best for ecosystem seeding

Each format shares the same **core mechanics**, just compressed or expanded.

## <img src="/iconography/dd/education.svg" alt="What RaidGuild provides icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />What RaidGuild Provides

Depending on the engagement, RaidGuild may provide:

* **Hosts / Dungeon Masters**
* **Program design & customization**
* **Theme selection & scoping**
* **Workshop facilitation (e.g. MDD)**
* **Mentors and subject-matter experts**
* **Demo Day facilitation**
* **Evaluation & feedback**
* **Post-cohort synthesis & reporting**

Optional add-ons:

* Custom dashboards
* Agentic tooling (ShadowOrg)
* Documentation & artifact packaging
* Follow-on RAIDs or incubation support

---

## <img src="/iconography/dd/consultation.svg" alt="Partner responsibilities icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />Partner Responsibilities

To ensure success, partners typically provide:

* A clear problem space or theme
* Technical resources (SDKs, docs, RPCs, testnets)
* Optional funding, prizes, or grants
* Access to internal experts
* Post-cohort pathways (grants, contracts, roles)

CaaS works best when partners are **co-facilitators**, not spectators.

## <img src="/iconography/magic/crystal.svg" alt="CaaS outputs and value icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />Outputs & Value

A successful CaaS engagement produces:

* Working prototypes
* Reference implementations
* Research artifacts
* Docs or tooling improvements
* A cohort of trained, activated builders
* Clear signal on high-potential contributors
* Long-term relationships, not just demos

---

## <img src="/iconography/magic/stars.svg" alt="CaaS growth loop icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />CaaS as a Growth Loop

CaaS creates a flywheel:

1. Partner ecosystem hosts a cohort
2. Builders learn + build
3. Best contributors continue into partner ecosystem
4. Some builders join RaidGuild cohorts or RAIDs
5. Knowledge flows both ways

This positions RaidGuild as a **cross-ecosystem connective tissue**.

## <img src="/iconography/dd/culture.svg" alt="Why RaidGuild icon" className="rg-inline-icon" />Why RaidGuild

RaidGuild is uniquely positioned to offer CaaS because:

* We build in production, not theory
* We’ve run many cohorts already
* We combine technical depth with culture
* We value agency over compliance
* We optimize for long-term contribution

CaaS is an extension of what the Guild already does — just made portable.
