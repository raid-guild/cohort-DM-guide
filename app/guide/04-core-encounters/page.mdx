</div>

A cohort is built from a series of encounters — repeatable rituals and interactive moments that shape the group’s experience. These encounters are the DM’s primary tools for guiding participants through the month. Some are synchronous and social; others are async and meant to spark momentum.

This section outlines the major encounters, their purpose, how to run them, and resources you can use to make each session smooth and effective.

# **🔥 4.1 Encounter: The Info Session + Welcome Ritual (Week 1 — Day 1)**

**Resources (DM Toolkit):**

* *Info Session Deck* [(template)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17ik9DJTz2o5VOg0QJ07GZXvGxFoHeaSa7l0OYapmR0M/edit?usp=sharing)
* [*RaidGuild Agency Deck*](https://raidguild.org/deck)
* [*RaidGuild Handbook*](https://handbook.raidguild.org/) (culture, roles, ops)

> The DM should update templates to match the cohort number and theme

**Instructions:**

1. Open with a warm, human welcome.
2. Do short introductions (keep it snappy).
3. Present the guild overview deck.
4. Theme reveal.
5. Q&A.

# **🛡️ 4.2 Encounter: The Raider Showcase (Week 1 — Day 2)**

**Purpose:**
Expose participants to the real rhythm of RaidGuild — active projects, RIPs, OG experiments, and weird in-progress things.

This is one of the most important cultural encounters. Many participants have an “aha” moment here.

**What to emphasize:**

* RG is a **living network**, not a corporate org
* Self-direction is expected
* Opportunities are everywhere
* Raiders create their own work, pathways, and outcomes
* Being part of RG means participating in a community of builders, not waiting for assignments

**DM Instructions:**

1. Prep the cohort: “Today you observe the real guild.”
2. Have them sit quietly and watch.
3. After the meeting, run a short debrief:

   * What did they notice?
   * What surprised them?
   * What feels exciting?
   * What feels intimidating?

> there should be 10-30 min cohort session before and/or after the raound up(1hr) for expectation setting and feedback

**Resources:**

* *Standup Reference Guide* (outline/summary of what they saw)
* *How RAIDs & RIPs work* (mini doc)

# **⚡ 4.3 Encounter: Demo Day (Previous Cohort) + Debrief (Week 1 — Day 3)**

**Purpose:**
Demonstrate real output from the Guild. Establish standards. Spark inspiration.

**DM Instructions:**

* Have participants take notes during each demo.
* After the demos, run a guided reflection:

  * What worked well?
  * What ideas seemed promising?
  * What surprised you?
  * What minimum viable output did you see?

**Resources:**

* Demo Day Recording (if async members missed it)
* Demo Feedback Template
* *Project Archetypes* document (what kinds of projects are common and what is in a good demo)

**Outcome:**
Participants internalize what “shipping” looks like inside RG.
