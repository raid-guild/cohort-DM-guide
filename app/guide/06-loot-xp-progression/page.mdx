Progression in RaidGuild functions like an RPG advancement path — except instead of killing monsters, you ship things, collaborate, support the Guild, and show up consistently.

This section defines how players “level up” through the Guild, what loot they receive, and how they eventually become core members.

To be considered for core membership, a Raider must:

* Be a Cohort Graduate

This mechanism ensures responsible sponsorship and sustained engagement.

**Core Member Loot:**
