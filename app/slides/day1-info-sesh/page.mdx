    # RaidGuild Cohort Day 1
    ## Day 1 — Welcome, Orientation, Theme Reveal

    *“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”*
  </Slide>

  > *As the cold, bitter wind howls in the night, you finally spot a warm light coming from an old wooden building.*
  >
  > *The door creaks open. A fireplace crackles. The hum of conversation fills the air.*
  >
  > *A group of adventurers gathers around a large table.*
  >
  > *You’re not sure what to make of it — but curiosity gets the better of you.*
  >
  > **You’re here to learn more about the RaidGuild.**
</Slide>

  <Slide>
    ## Today’s goals
    - Meet each other (fast + human)
    - Learn how RaidGuild works (high-level)
    - Understand the cohort journey
    - Learn **how to participate** (Skills-Roles + Steward Hats)
    - Reveal the theme + immediate next steps
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## Ground rules
    - Be concise and kind
    - Curiosity > performance
    - Ask questions in chat (we’ll pause for Q&A)
    - This is a high-agency space — nobody is here to hold your hand
  </Slide>

  <Slide>
    ## Introductions (30 seconds each)
    **Answer quickly:**
    - What name do you go by?
    - One thing you want us to know about you
    - A hobby
    - A previous project
    - A dream of yours
    - Wildcard: how are you using AI in your daily life?
  </Slide>

    ## What is a DAO?
    **D.A.O. = Decentralized Autonomous Organization**

    - Decentralization is a spectrum
    - DAOs are a tool for human coordination
    - Governance happens socially, then is verified/enforced onchain
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## How RaidGuild operates (simple version)
    - Members stake into the DAO (goes to the treasury)
    - In return, members receive shares
    - Shares are used to vote on proposals, changes, and new members
    - The point: shared ownership + shared responsibility
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## Why DAOs (why now)
    - Coordination is hard
    - DAOs can reduce coordination costs (sometimes)
    - Fluid, creative, challenging — but powerful when aligned
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## Moloch (optional lore)
    Moloch is a metaphor for **coordination failure**.

    If you’re curious later:
    - *Meditations on Moloch* (Scott Alexander)
    - Bankless: *Ethereum, Slayer of Moloch*
    - Moloch Minion (RG tooling)
  </Slide>

  <Slide>
    ## What is RaidGuild?
    - A decentralized collective of mercenaries out to slay web3 demons
    - Practically: a digital cooperative of builders + operators
    - We prioritize shipping, quality, accountability, and respect
    - A networked model for the future of work
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## Code of Conduct (pillars)
    - **Professionalism** — ship
    - **Respect** — be kind
    - **Collaboration** — make new friends
    - **Honor** — be excellent to each other
    - **Free speech** — idea meritocracy
  </Slide>

  <Slide>
    ## Important: this is not a hackathon
    Hackathons often produce:
    - bounty-hunting behavior
    - drive-by participation
    - shallow relationships

    Our goal is:
    - community and real relationships
    - ongoing engagement
    - skin in the game
    - learning how the Guild actually works
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## Skills-Roles (how you contribute)
    Skills-Roles describe **the kind of work you do**.

    They are not titles. You can wear multiple roles.

    Examples:
    - Frontend / Backend / Smart Contracts (Wizard)
    - Design / UX (Ranger)
    - PM / Ops (Monk)
    - Research / Data / AI (Druid)
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## Steward Hats (how responsibility is held)
    Steward Hats describe **temporary responsibility**, not power.

    - Opt-in, revocable, role-based
    - Stewardship ≠ hierarchy
    - Stewards keep systems alive: tools, ops, membership, cohort, brand, etc.

    You are not expected to steward anything during the cohort —
    but it helps to notice how stewardship shows up.

    Examples:
    - Sync Steward: Meeting coordinations and information asymmetry
    - Brand Steward: Provide and Maintain brand materials and standards. 
  </Slide>

    ## The Cohort Journey (high level)
    - **Week 1:** interactive sessions (daily ~1–2 hrs)
    - **Weeks 2–4:** async building (with optional mentor touchpoints)
    - **Demo Day:** happens on Day 3 of the *next* cohort
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## Week 1 — Day by day
    - **Day 1:** Welcome + theme reveal
    - **Day 2:** Sit in on Monthly Raider Showcase (see the Guild in action)
    - **Day 3:** Last cohort Demo Day + start ideation
    - **Day 4:** Diverge (workshops, exploration, MDD, lightning talks)
    - **Day 5:** Converge (teams + project scoping)
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## Week 2 — Spec & Plan (async)
    - Decide roles
    - Clarify scope
    - Set up comms + repo + PM board
    - Define “what does success look like in 2 weeks?”
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## Weeks 3–4 — Build + Boss Rush Mode
    - Heads-down building
    - Testing + polish
    - Demo prep (script + deck + walkthrough)
    - Boss Rush Mode: ship something real
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## What happens after the cohort?
    - Finish the month → become a **Cohort Grad**
    - Cohort grads can attend weekly standups
    - Join a **RIP** (internal initiative) and/or a **RAID** (paid work)
    - Long path toward core membership (trust + contribution + sponsorship)
  </Slide>

  ---

  <Slide>
    ## Theme reveal
    ### This cohort’s theme is…
    ## **TBA in Session**

    Why this theme:
    - ecosystem momentum
    - guild needs
    - strong “build surface area” for 3–4 weeks
  </Slide>
