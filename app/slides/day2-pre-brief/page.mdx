    ## What today is
    - A window into how RaidGuild actually works
    - A live, unfiltered Guild check-in
    - A cultural moment, not a presentation
  </Slide>

  <Slide>
    ## Why we do this on Day 2
    - You’ve heard *about* the Guild
    - Today you **experience** it
    - This is often the moment people decide:
      - “yes, this is for me”
      - or “interesting, but not my path”
  </Slide>

    ## How to watch the Showcase
    Don’t try to understand everything.

    Instead, notice:
    - How people talk about work
    - How initiative shows up
    - How loosely (but seriously) things are coordinated
    - Where help is being asked for
  </Slide>

    ## RAIDs (paid work)
    A **RAID** is paid work done for:
    - clients
    - protocols
    - DAOs
    - sometimes the Guild itself

    - Teams are self-organized
    - Work is real
    - 10% goes to the Guild treasury as **Spoils**
  </Slide>

  <Slide>
    ## RIPs (internal work)
    A **RIP** is a RaidGuild Improvement Proposal.

    - Internal tools
    - Process improvements
    - Ops, research, experiments
    - Often unpaid, always visible

    Many core RG systems started as RIPs.

    ## Steward Hats (in practice)
    Some people you’ll see today are wearing **Steward Hats**.

    That means:
    - They’ve taken responsibility for something
    - Not authority — responsibility
    - Stewardship is opt-in and revocable

    Watch how stewardship shows up.

    ## Things you might feel
    - Confused
    - Excited
    - Overwhelmed
    - Inspired
    - Unsure

    All of these are normal.

    ## After the Showcase
    We’ll regroup and reflect.

    We’ll ask:
    - What stood out?
    - What kind of work interested you?
    - What felt unclear?
    - What surprised you?
  </Slide>

    ## Your only job right now
    Observe.
    
    Don’t perform.  
    Don’t compare yourself.  
    Just notice.
  </Slide>

    ## Let’s head in
    You’re about to sit with the Guild
    while it talks to itself.

    Welcome to the fire.
